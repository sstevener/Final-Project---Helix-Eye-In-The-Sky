# Final-Project---Helix-Eye-In-The-Sky

Team Helix’s project focused on creating and implementing machine learning enhancements for a home security camera system.

Almost all of today’s DIY home security systems allow users to receive an alert when movement is detected and recorded.

Movement can be caused by any number of things
  o	People
  o	Vehicles
  o	Wildlife
  o	Weather (moving tree limbs/leaves, rain, snow, etc.) 
  o	Insects
  o	Blowing trash
  o	Changes in ambient lighting (sunrise, sunset, clouds, etc.)

One of the most common user complaints about DIY security systems is receiving too many false positive alerts. These false positive alerts are overwhelming, annoying, and can lead users to ignore alerts or deactivate this important feature altogether.

While users do have some basic options to help reduce false alerts, such as reducing camera sensitivity settings or masking motion detection zones, both tactics can lead to missed detection opportunities.

We wanted to try to eliminate false alerts altogether.

Our goal was to
  o	Create a machine learning powered system that, in real-time, evaluates and identifies specific content in an image,
  o	And send an alert ONLY when the presence of a person or unrecognized automobile is detected.
